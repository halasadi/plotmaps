# plotmaps

An R-package for plotting the output of the MAPS software (https://github.com/halasadi/MAPS). 

This code heavily adapts code from the EEMS plotting scripts (https://github.com/dipetkov/eems/tree/master/plotting)
and Ben Peter's plotting scripts (https://github.com/BenjaminPeter/eems-around-the-world-draft/tree/master/scripts).
